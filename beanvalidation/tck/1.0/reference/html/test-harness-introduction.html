  its key features.</p><p>The JBoss Test Harness is a testing framework based on TestNG that
  provides a series of extensions that allow runtime packaging and deployment
  of Java EE artifacts (EAR or WAR) for in-container testing. It's important
  to note that the JBoss Test Harness has no relation with, or dependency on,
  the JBoss Application Server (JBoss AS).</p><div xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="note"><h2>Note</h2><p>You'll often see the term <span class="italic">in-container</span> used in this reference guide. This
    term refers to running the test suite in any of the aforementioned
    environments, whilst <span class="italic">standalone</span> refers
    to running the tests outside the container via an implementation-specific
    standalone bootstrap. The standalone mode only runs those tests which the
    Bean Validation RI can run without deployment in a Java EE
    container.</p></div><p>The last thing Java developers want is yet another testing framework
  to make their life more complicated. That's why the JBoss Test Harness is
  built entirely upon TestNG. TestNG is one of two prominent test frameworks
  for Java (the other being JUnit). Furthermore, what developers want is a
  good integration with their Integrated Development Environment (IDE). These
  days, if a tool doesn't have an IDE plugin, then it won't get the attention
  it deserves. TestNG plugins are available for all major IDEs and build tools
  (Ant and Maven 2). Again, a motivating factor for extending TestNG.</p><p>Because it leverages the existing TestNG ecosystem, there is no need
  for a special test launcher for the JBoss Test Harness. You simply use the
  IDE or build tool of your choice (so long as it has TestNG support). You
  also get reporting and debugging for free (various reporting plugins are
  provided for TestNG).</p><p>You can read more about TestNG at <a class="ulink" href="http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html">testng.org</a>.</p><p>The JBoss Test Harness supports the following features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>Test activation via any method supported by the TestNG
      configuration descriptor (package, group, class)</p></li><li><p>Exclusion of in-container tests in standalone mode</p></li><li><p>Exclusion of individual tests labeled as under

  <code class="literal">@org.testng.annotations.Test</code> in a class which extends
  <code class="literal">org.jboss.testharness.AbstractTest</code> and is annotated with
  <code class="literal">@org.jboss.testharness.impl.packaging.Artifact</code>.</p><div xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="note"><h2>Note</h2><p>Test suites may often choose to extend
    <code class="literal">AbstractTest</code> and require tests to extend that base
    class. In fact, both the CDI TCK and the Bean Validation TCK provide base
    classes that extend <code class="literal">AbstractTest</code> to provide
    functionality specific to the needs of the TCK.</p></div><p>The <code class="literal">@Test</code> annotation is provided by TestNG, the
  <code class="literal">@Artifact</code> annotation is provided by the JBoss Test
  Harness and the <code class="literal">AbstractTest</code> is part of the JBoss Test
  Harness. There is a one-to-one mapping between a TestNG test class and an
  artifact. The packaging type is defined by the
  <code class="literal">@org.jboss.testharness.impl.packaging.Packaging</code>
  annotation on the test class, defaulting to a WAR if not specified.</p><p>Prior to executing the tests for a given class, the JBoss Test Harness
  packages the class as a deployable artifact (EAR or WAR), along with any
  extra resources specified, and deploys the artifact to the container. The
  harness provides test execution and result reporting via HTTP communication
  to a simple Servlet using a thin layer over the TestNG test launcher. The
  test harness can also catch and enforce expected deployment exceptions. This
  setup and tear down activity is provided by the super class
  <code class="literal">org.jboss.testharness.AbstractTest</code>, which all test
  classes must extend (directly or indirectly).</p><p>If the annotation
  <code class="literal">@org.jboss.testharness.impl.packaging.IntegrationTest </code> is
  not present on the test class, then it means the test class can be executed
  in standalone mode. In standalone mode, the deployable artifact is assembled
  on the local classpath and the tests execute in the same JVM as the
  launcher, just as though it were a regular TestNG test case. The standalone
  mode is provided for convenience and efficiency, allowing you the speed of
  mock-based testing and the confidence of an in-container test, using the
  same test objects and tests.</p><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="in-container-communication"/>8.1. Negotiating the execution of an
    in-container test</h2></div></div></div><p>The basic procedure of an in-container test is as follows. The JBoss
    Test Harness produces a deployable artifact from an
    <code class="literal">@Artifact</code> test class and any declared dependent
    classes, descriptors or other resources. Then it deploys the artifact to
    the container using the <code class="literal">Containers</code> SPI, negotiates with
    the container to execute the test and return the result and, finally,
    undeploys the artifact. TestNG collects the results of all the tests run
    in the typical way and produces a report.</p><div align="center"><img src="images/in-container-execution.png" align="middle"/></div><p>The question is, how does the JBoss Test Harness negotiate with the
    container to execute the test when TestNG is being invoked locally?
    Technially the mechanism is pluggable, but JBoss Test Harness provides a
    default implementation that uses HTTP communication that you will likely
    use. Here's how the default implementation works.</p><p>The artifact generator bundles and registers (in the web.xml
    descriptor) an <code class="literal">HttpServlet</code>,
    <code class="literal">org.jboss.testharness.impl.runner.servlet.ServletTestRunner</code>,
    that responds to test execution GET requests. TestNG running on the client
    side delegates to a test launcher (more on that in a moment) which
    originates these text execution requests to transfer control to the
    container JVM. The name of the test method to be executed is specified in
    a request query parameter named <code class="literal">methodName</code>.</p><p>When the test execution request is received, the servlet delegates
    to an instance of
    <code class="literal">org.jboss.testharness.impl.runner.TestRunner</code>, passing
    it the name of the test method. <code class="literal">TestRunner</code> reads the
    name of the test class from the resource
    META-INF/jboss-test-harness.properties, which is bundled in the artifact
    by the artifact generator. It then combines the class name and the method
    name to produce a TestNG test suite and runs the suite (within the context
    of the container).</p><p>TestNG returns the results of the run as an
    <code class="literal">ITestResult</code> object.
    <code class="literal">ServletTestRunner</code> translates this object into a
    <code class="literal">org.jboss.testharness.api.TestResult</code> and passes it back
    to the test launcher on the client side by encoding the translated object
    into the response. The object gets encoded as either html or a serialized
    object, depending on the value of the <code class="literal">outputMode</code>
    request parameter that was passed to the servlet. Once the result has been
    transfered to the client-side TestNG, TestNG wraps up the run of the test
    as though it had been executed in the same JVM.</p><p>There's one piece missing. How does TestNG on the client side know
    to submit a request to the <code class="literal">ServletTestRunner</code> servlet to
    get TestNG to execute the test in the container JVM? That's the role of
    the test launcher.</p><p>The test launcher is the API that allows test suite to launch the
    test in a pluggable fashion. <code class="literal">AbstractTest</code> implements
    <code class="literal">IHookable</code>, a TestNG interface which allows the
    execution of the test method to be intercepted. Using that mechanism,
    <code class="literal">AbstractTest</code> delegates execution of the test method (a
    method annotated with <code class="literal">@Test</code> in an
    <code class="literal">@Artifact</code> class) to an implementation of
    <code class="literal">org.jboss.testharness.api.TestLauncher</code> if the tests are
    being executed in-container. As you might anticipate, the implementation
    is specified using a property with the same name as the interface in a
    META-INF/jboss-test-launcher.properties resource. The JBoss Test Harness
    provides a default implementation,
    <code class="literal">org.jboss.testharness.impl.runner.servlet.ServletTestLauncher</code>,
    that hooks into the HTTP communication infrastructure described above. It
    invokes the <code class="literal">ServletTestRunner</code> servlet for each method
    annotated with <code class="literal">@Test</code> in the
    <code class="literal">@Artifact</code> that is not otherwise disabled.</p><p>If you wish to implement the runner yourself, you must return a
    <code class="literal">TestResult</code> as a result of executing the method in the
    container. You must also ensure that any exception which occurs during
    deployment is wrapped as a
    <code class="literal">org.jboss.testharness.api.DeploymentException</code>, and that
    any communication problem is rethrown as an
    <code class="literal">IOException</code>. The deployment exception may be
    transformed by an implementation of the
    <code class="literal">org.jboss.testharness.api.DeploymentExceptionTransformer
    </code> interface, which is specified using the
    <code class="literal">org.jboss.testharness.container.deploymentExceptionTransformer
    </code> property. The default implementation passes on the original
    exception unchanged. </p><p>So in short, JBoss Test Harness takes care of all the interfaces you
    need to execute tests in-container except for the implementation of the
    <code class="literal">Containers</code> SPI. That is, unless you are deploying to
    one of the containers supported by the JBoss Test Harness.</p></div></div><HR xmlns=""/><a xmlns="" href=""><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="copyright">Copyright © 2009 - 2011 Red Hat, Inc.</p></a><ul class="docnav"><li class="previous"><a accesskey="p" href="test-harness.html"><strong>Prev</strong>Part III. JBoss Test Harness</a></li><li class="up"><a accesskey="u" href="#"><strong>Top of page</strong></a></li><li class="home"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html"><strong>Front page</strong></a></li><li class="next"><a accesskey="n" href="test-harness-configuration.html"><strong>Next</strong>Chapter 9. Configuration</a></li></ul></body></html>
